fly-interpolate
------------------


This MATLAB module would read 'ctrax' specific file data for object positions in x,y coordinates and would interpolate missing information and would correct the 'mat' file by comparing it with the Ground Truth file.

This project was done as a part of research for studying the flying pattern of fireflies. The MATLAB code here would read application specific spreadsheet document and fix missing information and correct data file for further analysis.

This may be too specific for general public use but I hope that someone can benefit from interpolation techniques used in this program.
